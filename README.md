# HTML-Accessibility

## Description

This HTML and CSS code is the refactored version of the Horiseon website. A more accessible and useable version of the website, which was created so that those requiring screen readers can use the site too. Through this process I have learned a great deal on using git to push and pull code, which I can now do by heart. I have also learned how to format HTML and CSS to make it easier to read and how to consolidate css so that you don't have to look through many sections to change one thing.
